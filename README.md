## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Connecting Devices
1.  Open **ShadowAI** on your Desktop.
2.  Open **ShadowAI** on your Mobile (make sure both are on the same Wi-Fi/Network).
3.  The "Available Devices" list will populate automatically.

### 2. Device Pairing (Security)
1.  Find your **Device ID** (top-left, e.g., `X7A9B2C1`).
2.  On the other device, enter this ID in the "Pair Device" box and click ✔️.
3.  Accept the request on the target device.
4.  Once paired, you can view live feeds and control the camera.

### 3. Remote Vision & AI
1.  Click the **Camera Icon** 📷 next to a paired device in the sidebar.
2.  The remote device will take a photo and upload it.
3.  ShadowAI analyzes the image (using your selected AI model) and displays the result on **all connected devices**.
